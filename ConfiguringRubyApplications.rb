# There are a number of outside resources we can leverage in working 
# with our Ruby Application 

# Rsepc is a Ruby-specified library or gem 
# We leverage this testing tool for behavior-driven testing 

# As we start to build out more complex applications, it's standard to untilize libraries 
# and other conventsion for setting up Ruby applications 
# This will save time and offer common template that is familar to Ruby developers 

# We'll cover topics including:
